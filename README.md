ISSUES IN THE ORIGINAL CODE:
The original code is difficult to update and understand because everything is inside one function, compute_deductions(salary), reducing reusability. It lacks separate functions for SSS, Pag-IBIG, PhilHealth, and tax calculations. Fixed values (e.g., sss = 1200, pagibig = 100, tax = 1875) make adjustments harder. Unclear function and variable names, no error handling for invalid inputs, and inefficient result display using multiple print() statements add to its problems.

CODE ENHANCEMENTS:
The improved code introduces an Employee class for organized salary calculations. Each deduction has its own function, reducing complexity and improving maintainability. Hardcoded values are minimized, and tax calculations now follow salary brackets. Clearer naming improves readability, while get_valid_salary() ensures valid input. Results are now displayed using a structured dictionary and a loop, making the code more readable, maintainable, and adaptable.
